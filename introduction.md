## What is a design pattern?

Designing software presents challenges that need reliable and reusable solutions. Design patterns are battle-tested and reusable solutions to common software design problems.

> Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.
> -- *Christopher Wolfgang Alexander*

- Design patterns in software development were popularized by the gang of four authors in their book "Design patterns"
- A design pattern helps us identify a problem and presents a tested solution
- A design pattern must be reusable and must produce a reliable outcome
