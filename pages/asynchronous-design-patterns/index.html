<h3 id="the-event-loop">The event loop</h3>
<p>The purpose of the event loop is to make sure that all the code is handled. JavaScript has a single threaded environment, we can only execute one piece of code at a time. But the event loop makes it possible to achieve asynchronicity because we&#39;re able to set code aside such as a callback that was created by set timeout, set that aside and then the event loop will check for that and make sure that it gets taken care of when it&#39;s time to execute that.</p>
<h3 id="callbacks">Callbacks</h3>
<p>Traditionally the callbacks were the only way of acheiving asyncronicity in javascipt. The modern patterns like Promises / Async await relies on callbacks, so its important to understand them.</p>
<p>A Callback is simply a function that is invoked after something else happens and it is acheived by passing a function to another function as an argument in Javascript. The function that we pass to an other function, is called back after something else happens. </p>
