      <h1 id="command-pattern">Command Pattern</h1>
<p><strong>Command</strong> is a behavorial design pattern that turns a <strong>request</strong> into a <strong>stand-alone object</strong> that contains all information about the request. This transformation let&#39;s you parameterize methods whith different requests, delay or queue a request&#39;s execution, and support undoable operations.</p>
<p>In many ways, you see examples of the command pattern all around you in software. For instance, a menu in an image manipulation software allows you to color correct or add filter effects to a photo. In this case, the intricacies of the individual commands are unknown to the menu, which we&#39;ll call as the <strong>invoker</strong>. </p>
<p>The <strong>invoker</strong> is used by the <strong>client</strong> to invoke a command. <em>It doesn&#39;t need to know how the command works on the inside</em>. </p>
<p>So, the command design pattern essentially contains an <strong>invoker</strong> object which is designed to <strong>execute</strong> a given <strong>command</strong>. Every command must encapsulate its internals, and should expose an <strong>execute</strong> function which the <strong>invoker</strong> will execute. This interface should remain consistent across all commands. Additionally, the invoker should keep a stack of commands that have been executed, and allow undoability. </p>
<p>Most applications such as text, code, and image-editing apps allow you to undo the last command or a series of commands in the last-in, first-out order. </p>
<p>The commands themselves affect or modify a <strong>receiver</strong> which receives the end result of the command being executed. Commands can inherit from a base Command class that should minimally offer an execute method and an undo method. </p>
<ul>
<li>The command pattern makes it easy to craft a uniform interface known as an invoker that issues commands which encapsulate the inner workings of the operation. </li>
<li>The invoker exposes a simple interface consisting of an execute command, which takes in an instance of a Command class and executes the command&#39;s own execute function. </li>
<li>The end result of every command is the receiver, which receives the final outcome of the action. </li>
<li>This pattern allows you to write a diverse set of operations without affecting or refactoring the invoker interface which is used by the client. </li>
<li>Command objects with the same interface can easily be swapped as needed and this is considered one of the larger benefits of the pattern.</li>
</ul>
